# - 2 CPU Threads
# - 2GB RAM
# - 6GB SSD

# reason: unused, improved compatibility

# adjust memory usage

# increase statistics target
# reason: more accurate query plans

# reason: safeguard resource usage

# reason: unused, reduced resource usage

# reason: reduced IO usage, higher throughput

# group WAL commits during high load (delay 100ms)
# reason: higher throughput

# reduce checkpoint frequency
# reason: higher chance of vaccuming in-memory, reduced WAL usage

# adjust configuration for SSDs
# reason: improved performance on expected hardware

# reason: useful for development
